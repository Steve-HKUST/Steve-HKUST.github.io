## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amy, an App Developer ðŸ“± from China who is passionate about technologies and innovation

I'm fun to work with, I always like to learn new things from others as much as helping others solve their problems. You know what else is fun! Learning code is. Let's work for a better opensource, decentralized future. A world where everything is free and everyone is free to experiment, learn, survive and thrive. Let's code for good.
